There is a Vedic or Puranic deity Harihara Putra, born out of the holy union of Siva and the feminine form of Vishnu called Mohini at the Samudra Manthan (churning of milky ocean) during the Koorma Avatar (incarnation of Maha Vishnu as Turtle) at the beginning of the present Chatur Yuga. Another legend is related to the killing of Vrikasura (Bhasmasura), during the second incarnation of Vishnu as Mohini, from a later period.","Then there is a historical person, Manikantan, related to the Pandya dysnasty of Madurai in present day Tamil Nadu. This is from a period 800 years ago. This legend is described below. Bhootanatha Upakhyanam, extracted from Brahmanda Puranam and retold in Malayalam by Shri. Kallarackal Krishnan Nair and another translation by Shri. P.N. Krishnanunni and a third book Bhootanatha Sarvaswam by Shri. Kurumulloor Narayana Pillai are considered as authentic references for Ayyappa the historical person.","The members of Pandya dynasty ousted by Tirumala Naicker, the ruler of the Pandya Empire spanning Madurai, Tirunelveli and Ramanathapuram lived in places like Valliyur, Tenkasi, Shenkottai, Achankovil and Sivagiri. They had also established their supremacy in parts of Travancore, and some of them belonging to Chempazhanattu Kovil in Sivagiri were given the right to rule the province of Pandalam by the King of Travancore, some eight hundred years ago. King Rajashekhara, the foster father of Lord Ayyappa belonged to this dynasty.","A just and precocious sovereign King Rajashekhara was held by his subjects in high esteem. Under him, the region was witnessing a golden age. But the king had one sorrow: he was childless and thus had no heir to inherit his throne. Both the hapless king and his queen prayed fervently to Lord Shiva for a child.","Around the same time, a demon by the name of Mahishasura (in the shape of a bullock) undertook severe penance (tapas) and consequently Lord Brahma was forced to grant his wish that nobody on earth could annihilate him. Emboldened by Brahma’s boon, Mahishasura commenced systematic destruction of people and pulverized tribes and communities. Terrorized and fearing his wrath, people fled to distant lands. Realizing that only a superhuman power could exterminate the wayward Mahishasura, the devas appealed to Goddess Durga, who killed him in a fierce battle.","Determined to avenge her slain brother, Mahishi, the sister of Mahishasura secured a boon from Lord Brahma that no being except the offspring of Vishnu (Hari) & Shiva (Haran) could slay her. In due course of time, Mahishi went to Devaloka and began harassing the Devas who in turn implored Lord Vishnu to intervene. As the boon was that nobody except the son of Lord Shiva & Vishnu could kill Mahishi, Lord Vishnu assumed the female persona of Mohini (beautiful lady) who was instrumental in the killing of Vrikasura (Bhasmasua). The Mohini avatar of Vishnu earlier was to help the devas get the divine prize Amrit, immortal nectar, came out of Samudra Manthan, churning of milky ocean, away from the asuras. The male child born out of the union of Mohini (Vishnu) and Lord Shiva was placed at the bank of Pampa river.","On one of his hunting trips to the forests near River Pampa, as King Rajashekhara reclined on the banks of river mulling over the natural beauty of the surroundings and waterfalls, he heard an infant’s wails from the forest. Astounded, he followed the sounds and came upon a beautiful child furiously kicking its feet and arms. The king stood there, perplexed – he longed to take the child home to his palace.","Whilst King Rajashekhara beheld the divine child, a sadhu appeared from nowhere and instructed him to take the infant to his palace. Also the mendicant assured him that the child would mitigate his dynasty’s sufferings and that when the boy turned twelve, Rajashekhara would be aware of his divinity. As the child was wearing a gold chain with bell (mony), the sadhu directed the King to name him Manikandan, one with a golden neck.","Ecstatic, Rajashekhara took Manikandan home and narrated the happenings to his queen. They both felt that they had been blessed by Lord Shiva himself. All except the Diwan/minister who had entertained hopes of becoming the king after Rajashekhara, rejoiced in the royal couple’s happiness.","As a child, Manikandan was very intelligent and precocious. He excelled in martial arts and shastras and surprised his guru with his brilliance and superhuman talents. Peace and prosperity reigned in Pandalam. Eventually, Ayyappan’s guru concluded that the boy was no ordinary mortal but a divine being. Upon completing his studies, Manikandan went up to his teacher to offer guru dakshina and seek his blessings in turn.","As he approached his spiritual master for asheerwaad (blessing), the guru explained to Manikandan what he had already surmised about him, that he was a divine power destined for superhuman glory. The guru then beseeched him to bestow vision and speech upon his son who was blind and dumb. Manikandan placed his hands on the guru’s son and the boy immediately gained eyesight and speech. Requesting that this miracle be revealed to none, Manikandan returned to the palace.","Manikantan had learnt martial arts, organized local people, in the name of Yogams and taught them warfare and martial arts to prepare them against thieves, looters and enemies. He had killed Udayanan, a looter with base at Karimala, who had abducted the princess of Pandalam. When Vaparan, another warrior, a thief and looter attacked poor peole of Pandala kingdom, Manikantan fought with him, endowed him with good advices and finally made him a good friend.","Meanwhile the Queen had given birth to a male child who was named Raja Rajan. Sensing that these miraculous turn of events were somehow inextricably linked to Manikandan, Rajasekhara, decided to crown him King; he obviously considered Lord Ayyappan his eldest son. Everybody with the exception of the King’s Diwan got dejected. This wily minister, who secretly nursed kingly ambitions, hated Manikandan and devised manifold plots, including poisoning of food to exterminate the divine avatar. Manikandan had a few narrow escapes, yet his body bore an injury that none could cure. Finally, Lord Shiva himself in the garb of a healer cured the young boy.","His plans foiled, the Diwan told, injecting poison in the minds of the Queen that it was highly improper for Manikandan to succeed Rajashekhara, as her own son was alive who will have to suffer a lot if Manikandan were to become the king. Since Arthasastra considers that ends justify the means, he instigated her to feign illness; he assured the Queen that he would make his physician proclaim that she could be cured only by the application of a tigress’ milk. Manikandan would be impelled to go to the forest where he would fall a prey to wild animals, or even if he returned home without accomplishing the task, Rajashekhara’s love for him would not be the same as before. Blinded by her attachment for her own son, the Queen vowed to help the Diwan and pretended as though she was suffering from a terrible headache. The King grew alarmed and summoned his physicians who were unable to revive the seemingly ailing Queen. Eventually the Diwan’s accomplice physician declared that she would be cured of the malady only if the milk of a lactating tigress were made available. Rajashekhara proclaimed that he would hand over half his kingdom to anybody who could cure the hapless Queen.","The team of soldiers sent by Rajashekhara with the sole purpose of getting the milk returned empty handed. Manikandan offered to help, but the King would not heed his pleas to go to the forest, citing the boy’s tender age and impending coronation as reasons. Unperturbed, Manikandan requested his father to do him a favour. Rajashekhara, ever the indulgent parent relented immediately; the boy seizing the opportunity pressed him to let him collect the milk. Manikandan stalled Rajashekhara’s efforts to organize a band of brave men to accompany him into the forest; he argued that the tigress would leave silently upon seeing the crowd of soldiers. Reluctantly Rajashekhara bid farewell to his favourite son.","The Bhootagana/servants of Lord Shiva closely followed Manikandan as he entered the forest. But on the way, he chanced to witness the atrocities of the demoness Mahishi even in Devaloka. His sense of justice outraged, Manikandan hurled Mahishi onto the earth below; she fell on the banks of the Azhutha River. A bloody battle soon ensued and at the end, Manikandan mounted Mahishi’s chest and commenced a violent dance that reverberated within the earth and the Devaloka. Even the Devas were frightened. Mahishi realized that the divine being on her was the son of Hari and Haran, chastened, she prostrated before the young boy and died.","Following his confrontation with Mahishi, Manikandan entered the forest for tigress’ milk. He had a darshan of Lord Shiva who informed him that even though he had fulfilled the divine plan, he still had one major task to accomplish. Manikandan was reminded about his grief stricken father and ailing mother; also he was assured of Lord Indra’s assistance in obtaining the much prized tigress’ milk. Manikandan made his way to the Royal palace on Lord Devendra, disguised as a tiger; they were accompanied by female devas in the guise of tigresses and male devas as tigers.","The people of Pandalam panicked upon seeing the boy and the tigers and hurriedly sought shelter.

Lord Manikandan told the King to renovate the existing Dharma Sastha temple in that place, built by Sage Parasurama, an avatar of Vishnu and then he disappeared. Manikandan then reached the Dharma Sastha temple, and merged with the murti of Dharma Sastha.","Later, acting upon the advice of Sage Agasthya, King Rajashekhara laid the foundation stone of the present temple at Sabarimala.

incarnation of Lord Ayyappa are in circulation. There is a Vedic or Puranic deity Harihara Putra, born out of the holy union of Siva and the feminine form of Vishnu called Mohini at the Samudra Manthan (churning of milky ocean) during the Koorma Avatar (incarnation of Maha Vishnu as Turtle) at the beginning of the present Chatur Yuga. Another legend is related to the killing of Vrikasura (Bhasmasura), during the second incarnation of Vishnu as Mohini, from a later period.","Then there is a historical person, Manikantan, related to the Pandya dysnasty of Madurai in present day Tamil Nadu. This is from a period 800 years ago. This legend is described below. Bhootanatha Upakhyanam, extracted from Brahmanda Puranam and retold in Malayalam by Shri. Kallarackal Krishnan Nair and another translation by Shri. P.N. Krishnanunni and a third book Bhootanatha Sarvaswam by Shri. Kurumulloor Narayana Pillai are considered as authentic references for Ayyappa the historical person.","The members of Pandya dynasty ousted by Tirumala Naicker, the ruler of the Pandya Empire spanning Madurai, Tirunelveli and Ramanathapuram lived in places like Valliyur, Tenkasi, Shenkottai, Achankovil and Sivagiri. They had also established their supremacy in parts of Travancore, and some of them belonging to Chempazhanattu Kovil in Sivagiri were given the right to rule the province of Pandalam by the King of Travancore, some eight hundred years ago. King Rajashekhara, the foster father of Lord Ayyappa belonged to this dynasty.","A just and precocious sovereign King Rajashekhara was held by his subjects in high esteem. Under him, the region was witnessing a golden age. But the king had one sorrow: he was childless and thus had no heir to inherit his throne. Both the hapless king and his queen prayed fervently to Lord Shiva for a child.","Around the same time, a demon by the name of Mahishasura (in the shape of a bullock) undertook severe penance (tapas) and consequently Lord Brahma was forced to grant his wish that nobody on earth could annihilate him. Emboldened by Brahma’s boon, Mahishasura commenced systematic destruction of people and pulverized tribes and communities. Terrorized and fearing his wrath, people fled to distant lands. Realizing that only a superhuman power could exterminate the wayward Mahishasura, the devas appealed to Goddess Durga, who killed him in a fierce battle.","Determined to avenge her slain brother, Mahishi, the sister of Mahishasura secured a boon from Lord Brahma that no being except the offspring of Vishnu (Hari) & Shiva (Haran) could slay her. In due course of time, Mahishi went to Devaloka and began harassing the Devas who in turn implored Lord Vishnu to intervene. As the boon was that nobody except the son of Lord Shiva & Vishnu could kill Mahishi, Lord Vishnu assumed the female persona of Mohini (beautiful lady) who was instrumental in the killing of Vrikasura (Bhasmasua). The Mohini avatar of Vishnu earlier was to help the devas get the divine prize Amrit, immortal nectar, came out of Samudra Manthan, churning of milky ocean, away from the asuras. The male child born out of the union of Mohini (Vishnu) and Lord Shiva was placed at the bank of Pampa river.","On one of his hunting trips to the forests near River Pampa, as King Rajashekhara reclined on the banks of river mulling over the natural beauty of the surroundings and waterfalls, he heard an infant’s wails from the forest. Astounded, he followed the sounds and came upon a beautiful child furiously kicking its feet and arms. The king stood there, perplexed – he longed to take the child home to his palace.","Whilst King Rajashekhara beheld the divine child, a sadhu appeared from nowhere and instructed him to take the infant to his palace. Also the mendicant assured him that the child would mitigate his dynasty’s sufferings and that when the boy turned twelve, Rajashekhara would be aware of his divinity. As the child was wearing a gold chain with bell (mony), the sadhu directed the King to name him Manikandan, one with a golden neck.","Ecstatic, Rajashekhara took Manikandan home and narrated the happenings to his queen. They both felt that they had been blessed by Lord Shiva himself. All except the Diwan/minister who had entertained hopes of becoming the king after Rajashekhara, rejoiced in the royal couple’s happiness.","As a child, Manikandan was very intelligent and precocious. He excelled in martial arts and shastras and surprised his guru with his brilliance and superhuman talents. Peace and prosperity reigned in Pandalam. Eventually, Ayyappan’s guru concluded that the boy was no ordinary mortal but a divine being. Upon completing his studies, Manikandan went up to his teacher to offer guru dakshina and seek his blessings in turn.","As he approached his spiritual master for asheerwaad (blessing), the guru explained to Manikandan what he had already surmised about him, that he was a divine power destined for superhuman glory. The guru then beseeched him to bestow vision and speech upon his son who was blind and dumb. Manikandan placed his hands on the guru’s son and the boy immediately gained eyesight and speech. Requesting that this miracle be revealed to none, Manikandan returned to the palace.","Manikantan had learnt martial arts, organized local people, in the name of Yogams and taught them warfare and martial arts to prepare them against thieves, looters and enemies. He had killed Udayanan, a looter with base at Karimala, who had abducted the princess of Pandalam. When Vaparan, another warrior, a thief and looter attacked poor peole of Pandala kingdom, Manikantan fought with him, endowed him with good advices and finally made him a good friend.","Meanwhile the Queen had given birth to a male child who was named Raja Rajan. Sensing that these miraculous turn of events were somehow inextricably linked to Manikandan, Rajasekhara, decided to crown him King; he obviously considered Lord Ayyappan his eldest son. Everybody with the exception of the King’s Diwan got dejected. This wily minister, who secretly nursed kingly ambitions, hated Manikandan and devised manifold plots, including poisoning of food to exterminate the divine avatar. Manikandan had a few narrow escapes, yet his body bore an injury that none could cure. Finally, Lord Shiva himself in the garb of a healer cured the young boy.","His plans foiled, the Diwan told, injecting poison in the minds of the Queen that it was highly improper for Manikandan to succeed Rajashekhara, as her own son was alive who will have to suffer a lot if Manikandan were to become the king. Since Arthasastra considers that ends justify the means, he instigated her to feign illness; he assured the Queen that he would make his physician proclaim that she could be cured only by the application of a tigress’ milk. Manikandan would be impelled to go to the forest where he would fall a prey to wild animals, or even if he returned home without accomplishing the task, Rajashekhara’s love for him would not be the same as before. Blinded by her attachment for her own son, the Queen vowed to help the Diwan and pretended as though she was suffering from a terrible headache. The King grew alarmed and summoned his physicians who were unable to revive the seemingly ailing Queen. Eventually the Diwan’s accomplice physician declared that she would be cured of the malady only if the milk of a lactating tigress were made available. Rajashekhara proclaimed that he would hand over half his kingdom to anybody who could cure the hapless Queen.","The team of soldiers sent by Rajashekhara with the sole purpose of getting the milk returned empty handed. Manikandan offered to help, but the King would not heed his pleas to go to the forest, citing the boy’s tender age and impending coronation as reasons. Unperturbed, Manikandan requested his father to do him a favour. Rajashekhara, ever the indulgent parent relented immediately; the boy seizing the opportunity pressed him to let him collect the milk. Manikandan stalled Rajashekhara’s efforts to organize a band of brave men to accompany him into the forest; he argued that the tigress would leave silently upon seeing the crowd of soldiers. Reluctantly Rajashekhara bid farewell to his favourite son.","The Bhootagana/servants of Lord Shiva closely followed Manikandan as he entered the forest. But on the way, he chanced to witness the atrocities of the demoness Mahishi even in Devaloka. His sense of justice outraged, Manikandan hurled Mahishi onto the earth below; she fell on the banks of the Azhutha River. A bloody battle soon ensued and at the end, Manikandan mounted Mahishi’s chest and commenced a violent dance that reverberated within the earth and the Devaloka. Even the Devas were frightened. Mahishi realized that the divine being on her was the son of Hari and Haran, chastened, she prostrated before the young boy and died.","Following his confrontation with Mahishi, Manikandan entered the forest for tigress’ milk. He had a darshan of Lord Shiva who informed him that even though he had fulfilled the divine plan, he still had one major task to accomplish. Manikandan was reminded about his grief stricken father and ailing mother; also he was assured of Lord Indra’s assistance in obtaining the much prized tigress’ milk. Manikandan made his way to the Royal palace on Lord Devendra, disguised as a tiger; they were accompanied by female devas in the guise of tigresses and male devas as tigers.","The people of Pandalam panicked upon seeing the boy and the tigers and hurriedly sought shelter. Soon after, the Sadhu, who had first materialized before Rajashekhara in the forest, when he heard a child’s wails appeared again and revealed Manikandan’s true identity to the wonder-struck king. The King grew silent and pensive, as Manikandan approached the palace gates with the tigers.

Pilgrims lead a simple, pious life known as ‘Vratam’ for successful completion. ‘Vratam’ ideally starts when the pilgrim adorns a maala, signifying willingness to undertake austerity. A bead chain with a locket of Lord Ayyappa may be worn. From then, he is addressed as ‘Ayyappa’. Life is to be free of worldly pleasures; food is strictly vegetarian; smoking, tobacco, narcotics and alcohol are strictly avoided; conjugal abstinence is observed. The Mala is to be accepted with prayers from a temple priest or a Guruswamy (one who has completed 18 pilgrimages), or alternatively, worn in one’s prayer room. The Mala is removed only after concluding the pilgrimage.","Mandala Vratam (41 days): ‘Mandala Vratam’ denotes 41 days of austerity. Wearing the Mala denotes onset of ‘Vratam’. Many consider Saturday or the day of Utram (the birth star of Lord Ayyappa) as auspicious to begin. The goal is to cultivate discipline and healthy practices through sustained self‑control and prayer. Black attire is recommended, denoting detachment from material things. Personal grooming such as cutting hair, shaving, and trimming nails is avoided during this period.","Kettunirakkal / Preparation of Irumudi: This ritual prepares and packs the ‘Irumudi kettu’ under a Guruswamy’s guidance. Only those carrying the Irumudi on the head are permitted to climb the 18 sacred steps. Others take a different passage to the north to reach the sanctum for worship. During Kettunira, after initial prayers, ghee (clarified cow’s butter) — the sacred offering — is filled into a coconut after removing the fibrous cover and draining its water through a small hole. This symbolizes draining worldly attachments from the mind and filling it with spiritual aspirations (jeeva‑atma). The ghee‑filled coconut (‘neyy‑thenga’) symbolizes the devotee’s body (shell), the ghee within as the jeeva‑atma. The front compartment of the Irumudi is filled with the neyy‑thenga and offerings to Lord Ayyappa and accompanying deities, then tied closed; it is believed vibrant with spiritual power. The rear compartment is filled with food for the journey and coconuts to be broken at holy spots.","Petta‑Thullal: In his incarnation as the son of the Pandalam Raja, Shree Dharma Sastha formed ‘Yogams’ — groups of youths trained in ‘Kalari’ (martial arts) to protect the pious and uphold Dharma. Among many Yogams, five were prominent: 1) Ambalappuzha Yogam, 2) Aalangat Yogam, 3) Muhamma Yogam, 4) Cheerappanchira Yogam, 5) Manarkad Yogam. The first two continue to this day. Petta Thullal is the ritual dance at Erumely en route to Sabarimala, with Nadaswaram and Saranaghosham (‘swamy thinthaka thom, ayyappa thinthaka thom’), symbolising the slaying of demoness Mahishi by Lord Ayyappa. It marks the last leg of the annual pilgrimage on January 12 each year. Traditionally, Ambalappuzha Yogam performs first, beginning after sighting a kite near noon from Kochambalam at Petta junction, then paying respects at the Nainar mosque to Ayyappa’s trusted lieutenant, Vavar/Vapuran. The Aalangad Yogam begins after sighting a star in the daylight sky. After an overnight stay at Valiambalam, both trek to Pampa for the Pampa Sadya and later participate in the Makara Vilakku festival at Sannidhanam.","Mani Mandapam & Makara Vilakku (7 days): Thiruvabharanam (sacred gold ornaments of Lord Ayyappa) are kept at Srambickal Palace within the Pandalam Palace complex and are taken in procession to Sabarimala at season’s end; poojas are performed on the vigraha adorned with them, after which the ornaments are returned. Thiruvabharanam consists of three boxes (ornaments, dress materials and other items), carried by a 12‑member team to Sabarimala over ~3 days, reaching at sunset on Makara Samkranti. The first box goes to the sanctum; after poojas and deeparadhana, Makara Jyoti is seen from Ponnambalamedu.","The other two boxes contain: a gold kalasa/kumbham used on the 5th day for Kalabha Abhishekam; five natural color powders for Kalamezhuthu (1. turmeric, 2. burned rice husk/umikkari, 3. rice powder, 4. from the bark of ‘Vaaka’, 5. red mixture of lime and turmeric), prepared by the senior-most mother of Pandalam palace; the Thidambu of Ayyappa (face with moustache and eyes glittering with marataka/emerald); and two flags (Thalappara Kotta and Inchipppara Kotta) — all taken to the Mani Mandapam near Malikappurathamma temple.","Mani Mandapam is a plain room without any vigraha, opened only 7 days a year for poojas and rituals. It is considered the moolasthan (origin) of the temple — where Lord Ayyappa meditated before becoming one with the Dharma Sastha vigraha in the Sreekovil. On Makara Samkranti day, special noon poojas are conducted. The next day, after deeparadhana, Kalamezhuthu begins and finishes before Athazhappooja. The chaitanya (divine energy) of Lord Ayyappa is invoked (Aavahanam) into the Thidambu, taken atop a decorated elephant in procession with traditional torches and music (theevetti & vaadyam) led by the Malikappuram melsanthi towards Patinettampadi, followed by Naayaattu Vili (songs). The procession returns to Mani Mandapam; concluding poojas are performed and the Kalam is traditionally removed. The same sequence continues for the next 4 days, with different Kalams: Day 1 Ayyappa as Brahmachari; Day 2 as warrior; Day 3 as young prince (a representative from Pandalam, as father of Manikantan, stays in Rajamandapam west of Mani Mandapam till the festival ends); Day 5 as King with full decoration and crown. On Day 5, the procession touches the 18 steps and goes up to Saramkuthi, marking festival conclusion. It is clarified that on all five days, Lord Ayyappa — not Malikappurathamma — is taken on the decorated elephant. Lord bids farewell to devotees at Saramkuthi and returns without torches and music.

lakhs of women (‘Malikappuram’) outside this age group trek and receive darshan.","• When one begins vratham wearing mala/mudra, the whole family often joins; more than 50% of Hindu families in South India are directly or indirectly connected to Swamy Ayyappa."]}}),[]);return(0,i.jsxs)("section",{className:"mt-8 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-[280px_1fr] gap-6",children:[(0,i.jsxs)("aside",{className:"rounded-2xl border border-border bg-card/70 p-4 shadow-sm md:sticky md:top-28 self-start",children:[(0,i.jsx)("h2",{className:"text-sm font-bold text-[#D4AF37]",children:"Table of Contents"}),(0,i.jsx)("ul",{className:"mt-3 space-y-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground",children:ac.map(a=>{let e=a.icon;return(0,i.jsx)("li",{children:(0,i.jsxs)("button",{onClick:()=>af(a.id),className:"w-full text-left rounded-md px-2 py-1 transition-colors flex items-center gap-2 ".concat(ap===a.id?"bg-[#D4AF37]/20 text-[#D4AF37]":"text-white/80 hover:text-white hover:bg-white/5"),children:[e?(0,i.jsx)(e,{className:"h-4 w-4"}):null,(0,i.jsx)("span",{className:"font-bold",children:a.title})]})},a.id)})})]}),(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:"rounded-xl border border-border bg-card/70 p-5 shadow-sm",children:[(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex items-center justify-between gap-3",children:[(0,i.jsxs)("h3",{className:"text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold text-[#D4AF37] flex items-center gap-2",children:[ag?(0,i.jsx)(ag,{className:"h-5 w-5"}):null,"ayyappa-birth"===ap?(null==(a=aw[ab])?void 0:a.title)||ay.title:"upa-devathas"===ap?(null==(e=ak[ab])?void 0:e.title)||ay.title:"ulsavam"===ap?(null==(t=aM[ab])?void 0:t.title)||ay.title:"ponnambalamedu"===ap?(null==(h=ax[ab])?void 0:h.title)||ay.title:"rituals"===ap?(null==(v=aS[ab])?void 0:v.title)||ay.title:"guruthy"===ap?(null==(w=aA[ab])?void 0:w.title)||ay.title:"trek"===ap?(null==(k=aj[ab])?void 0:k.title)||ay.title:"18-steps"===ap?(null==(M=aT[ab])?void 0:M.title)||ay.title:"18-hills"===ap?(null==(x=aP[ab])?void 0:x.title)||ay.title:"anti"===ap?(null==(S=aN[ab])?void 0:S.title)||ay.title:"tips"===ap?(null==(A=aK[ab])?void 0:A.title)||ay.title:"facts"===ap&&(null==(j=aR[ab])?void 0:j.title)||ay.title]}),"ayyappa-birth"===ap&&(0,i.jsxs)("label",{className:"text-xs text-[#D4AF37] inline-flex items-center gap-2",children:[(0,i.jsx)("span",{children:"Language"}),(0,i.jsxs)("select",{value:ab,onChange:a=>av(a.target.value),className:"rounded-md bg-background/70 px-2 py-1 text-white ring-1 ring-border focus:outline-none focus:ring-2",children:[(0,i.jsx)("option",{value:"en",children:"English"}),(0,i.jsx)("option",{value:"ml",children:"Malayalam"}),(0,i.jsx)("option",{value:"hi",children:"Hindi"}),(0,i.jsx)("option",{value:"te",children:"Telugu"}),(0,i.jsx)("option",{value:"ta",children:"Tamil"}),(0,i.jsx)("option",{value:"kn",children:"Kannada"})]})]})]}),(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"mt-3 text-sm md:text-[15px] leading-7 text-white/90 space-y-4 text-left",children:"ayyappa-birth"===ap?(null!=(I=null==(T=null!=(E=aw[ab])?E:aw.en)?void 0:T.body)?I:[]).map((a,e)=>(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:a},e)):"upa-devathas"===ap?(null!=(U=null==(P=null!=(G=ak[ab])?G:ak.en)?void 0:P.body)?U:[]).map((a,e)=>(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:a},e)):"ulsavam"===ap?(null!=(F=null==(N=null!=(q=aM[ab])?q:aM.en)?void 0:N.body)?F:[]).map((a,e)=>(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:a},e)):"ponnambalamedu"===ap?(null!=(Q=null==(K=null!=(O=ax[ab])?O:ax.en)?void 0:K.body)?Q:[]).map((a,e)=>(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:a},e)):"rituals"===ap?(null!=(W=null==(R=null!=(Y=aS[ab])?Y:aS.en)?void 0:R.body)?W:[]).map((a,e)=>(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:a},e)):"guruthy"===ap?(null!=(_=null==(L=null!=(J=aA[ab])?J:aA.en)?void 0:L.body)?_:[]).map((a,e)=>(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:a},e)):"trek"===ap?(null!=($=null==(D=null!=(Z=aj[ab])?Z:aj.en)?void 0:D.body)?$:[]).map((a,e)=>(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:a},e)):"18-steps"===ap?(null!=(aa=null==(V=null!=(X=aT[ab])?X:aT.en)?void 0:V.body)?aa:[]).map((a,e)=>(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:a},e)):"18-hills"===ap?(null!=(at=null==(z=null!=(ae=aP[ab])?ae:aP.en)?void 0:z.body)?at:[]).map((a,e)=>(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:a},e)):"anti"===ap?(null!=(an=null==(B=null!=(ai=aN[ab])?ai:aN.en)?void 0:B.body)?an:[]).map((a,e)=>(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:a},e)):"tips"===ap?(null!=(ao=null==(C=null!=(ar=aK[ab])?ar:aK.en)?void 0:C.body)?ao:[]).map((a,e)=>(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:a},e)):"facts"===ap?(null!=(ah=null==(H=null!=(as=aR[ab])?as:aR.en)?void 0:H.body)?ah:[]).map((a,e)=>(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:a},e)):(0,i.jsxs)("p",{children:["Content coming soon.
